# Metaheuristics
A repository with metaheuristics code.

This repository will contain some of the metaheuristics that I learnt in MUIA and other kind of implementations from other papers.
Also will contain some of my own implementations.

The way to work with this metaheuristics is to use some generic data structures like  "list" or "numpy.array".

The way to use them should be clearly explained in a wiki or in a specific tutorial-documentation.
