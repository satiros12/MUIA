# MUIA : Universitary Master in Artificial Inteligence
A repository with code inspired in classes taken in the master's degree.

This repository will contain some of the techinques that I learnt in MUIA and other kind of implementations from other papers.
Also will contain some of my own implementations.

The way to work with most of the techniques is based on some generic data structures like  "list" or "numpy.array".

The way to use them should be clearly explained in a wiki or in a specific tutorial-documentation.

The main subject of the MUIA are:

  * Machine Learning

  * Bayesian Networks

  * Desicions Help Systems

  * Metaheuristics

  * Natural Language Processing

  * Simulators

  * Biomedical Informatics
